A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. 

A for loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. 

The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. 

For loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. 

he for statement is used to repeat a block of statements enclosed in curly braces. 

An increment counter is usually used to increment and terminate the loop. 

The for statement is useful for any repetitive operation and is often used in combination with arrays to operate on collections of data/pins. 

There are three parts to the for loop:

<pre>
for (initialization; condition; increment)
{
//statement(s);
}
</pre>

The initialization happens first and exactly once. Each time through the loop, the condition is tested; if it's true, the statement block, and the increment is executed, then the condition is tested again. 

When the condition becomes false, the loop ends.

### **Serial Output Example**

<pre>
void setup()
{
  int i;
  
  Serial.begin(9600);

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    Serial.print("i = ");
    Serial.println(i);
  }
}

void loop() {
}
</pre>

You will see this in the serial monitor window

<pre>
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
i = 7
i = 8
i = 9
</pre>

### Hardware Examples

In these examples we will connect an RGB led to our Arduino, this will be used in several examples. 

Here is a breadboard layout and schematic, we used a common anode type 

![](http://www.aboutmicros.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arduino-Uno-and-RGB-LED.png) 

We will only use the red led of the RGB led in these examples Â 

<pre>
//change the brightness of an LED
int redled = 11;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(redled, OUTPUT); //set the LED pin as an output
  Serial.begin(9600);
  for (int i=1; i <= 255; i++)
  {
    Serial.println("loop = ");
    Serial.println(i);
    analogWrite(redled, i);
    delay(10);
  }
}

void loop()
{
}
</pre>

In this example, we will flash the red led on and off 10 times
<pre>
//flash the red led of the RGB led 10 times 
int redled = 11; 

void setup() 
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  pinMode(redled, OUTPUT); //set the LED pin as an output 
  
  //this will run 10 times 
  for (int i=1; i <= 10; i++) 
  {
    Serial.print("loop = "); 
    Serial.println(i); 
    digitalWrite(redled, LOW); // led on delay(500); 
    digitalWrite(redled, HIGH); //led off delay(500); 
   }  
}   
   
void loop() 
{ }

</pre>
