When we create a function, it must be given a name. The naming convention for functions is the same as for variables:

* The function name can be made up of alphanumeric characters (A to Z; a to z; 0 to 9) and the underscore (_).
* The function name may not start with a number
* A function name must not be used that is the same as a language keyword or existing function.

A function must have a return type. If teh example function does not return anything, it will have a return type of void. 

The function body is made up of a variety of statements placed between braces {}.

1.  each function must have a unique name,
2.  the function name is followed by parentheses ()
3.  functions have a return type, e.g. void,
4.  the body of a function is enclosed in opening and closing braces {}.

To call the function, you use the function name followed by opening and closing parentheses and then put a semi colon after it. 

There are advantages of using functions is that they avoid having to write the same code over and over again. Every time you call a function, we are just reusing code that has been written once. 

If you were to write code that say performed the same task 5 times then if you wished to update this for some reason you would have to modify the code in 5 places but if you were to use a function and call it 5 times then all you have to do is modify the function. 

Functions can be used to break a sketch up into pieces which make it easier to understand 

There are 2 ways you can declare a function

### Arduino Example 1

Let's look at a very simple function which simply adds 2 numbers

<pre>
int sum_function (int x, int y) // function declaration 
{
   int z = 0;
   z = x + y;
   return z; // return the value
}

void setup () 
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  int result = 0;
  result = sum_function (9,4); //our function
  Serial.print(result); //display via serial monitor
}

void loop () 
{
}
</pre>

In the serial monitor window, you will see something like this

<pre>
13
</pre>

### Arduino Example 2

The second way is to defineÂ  a function and then declare it after the loop, lets see the example above written like that 

<pre>
int sum_function (int , int ); // function definition 

void setup () 
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  int result = 0;
  result = sum_function (9,4); //our function
  Serial.print(result); //display via serial monitor
}

void loop () 
{
}

int sum_function (int x, int y) // function declaration 
{
   int z = 0;
   z = x + y;
   return z; // return the value
}
</pre>

When you run this you will see the same result as before in the serial monitor window

<pre>
13
</pre>

### Arduino Example : RGB LED

Using an RGB led to let's see how we can use some functions in this example Here is the circuit for reference 

![](http://www.aboutmicros.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arduino-Uno-and-RGB-LED.png) 

We will switch the various red, green and blue led's on and switch the off - these will all be functions

<pre>
int redled = 11;
int blueled = 10;
int greenled = 9;


void setup() 
{
  pinMode(redled, OUTPUT); //set the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(blueled, OUTPUT); //set the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(greenled, OUTPUT); //set the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() 
{
int i = 1;
AllOff(); //AllOff function called
delay(1000);

  while(i&lt;=3)
  {
    switch (i) 
    {
    case 1:
      RedOn(); //RedOn function called
      delay(1000);
      break;
    case 2:
      BlueOn(); //BlueOn function called
      delay(1000);
      break;
    case 3:
      GreenOn(); //GreenOn function called
      delay(1000);
      break;
    default: 
      break;
    }
    i++;
  }
}

void AllOff()
{
  digitalWrite(redled, HIGH); // red led off
  digitalWrite(blueled, HIGH); //blue led off
  digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH); //green led off
}

void RedOn()
{
  digitalWrite(redled, LOW); // red led on
  digitalWrite(blueled, HIGH); //blue led off
  digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH); //green led off
}

void BlueOn()
{
  digitalWrite(redled, HIGH); // red led off
  digitalWrite(blueled, LOW); //blue led on
  digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH); //green led off
}

void GreenOn()
{
  digitalWrite(redled, HIGH); // red led off
  digitalWrite(blueled, HIGH); //blue led off
  digitalWrite(greenled, LOW); //green led on
}
</pre>
